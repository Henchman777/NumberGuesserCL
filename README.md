Random Number Guesser  
The program works currently on the command line by first giving some instructions to the user. First they need to choose a minimum value as well as a maximum value.  
These work as edge numbers for the program to choose a random number in between. The user then has to guess the number by providing input to the command line with their guess.  
The program will then limit the range of the guess depending on the users input.  
Here is a screenshot of what a typical game would look like.

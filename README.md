# NumberGuesserCL  
Random Number Guesser  
The program works currently on the command line by first giving some instructions to the user. First they need to choose a minimum value as well as a maximum value.  
These work as edge numbers for the program to choose a random number in between. The user then has to guess the number by providing input to the command line with their guess.  
The program will then limit the range of the guess depending on the users input.  

You can either download the python main.py script to run the game or download the RandomNumberGenerator folder and run the main.exe executable to begin the game.
